    "## Document classification\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform a more accurate, and cost effective document classification with Rhubarb's vector sampling functionality. Internally, Rhubarb uses Amazon Titan Multi-modal embedding model for this purpose. Here are the high level steps you will follow to setup a classifier, and then run document classifications with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are the documents classified?\n",
    "---\n",
    "The premise of classification based on vector sampling relies on the fact that you have a small set of labeled documents and their corresponding vectors (embeddings). Given this sample set, you can generate vector embeddings of a new document and perform similarity check with your sample set to determine which type of document the new document closely resembles to. \n",
    "\n",
    "For that, Rhubarb offers two methods of choice- \n",
    "1. **Cosine Similarity** (`cosine`) to measure the similarity of a new document's vector embeddings with the sample set of labeled vectors. Cosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It's derived from the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes (norms). For each class, it finds the maximum similarity score among all its vectors compared to the page's embedding. This score represents how closely the page's content resembles the content typical of that class. If the highest similarity score across all classes is below a certain threshold (unknown_threshold), it classifies the page as \"UNKNOWN\". This means that the page does not closely resemble any of the known classes above the specified confidence level. The UNKNOWN class is assigned the highest similarity score found, even though it's below the threshold (more on this later).\n",
    "2. **Euclidean distance**, also known as L2 distance (`l2`), measures the straight line distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. It is derived from the square root of the sum of the squared differences between corresponding elements of the two vectors. For each class, the Euclidean distance between the page's embedding and each of the class's sample vectors is calculated. Unlike cosine similarity, which measures the angle between vectors, Euclidean distance measures the magnitude of difference between vectors. A smaller Euclidean distance indicates a closer or more similar match between the vectors. Therefore, for each class, you would typically look for the minimum Euclidean distance between the page's embedding and the class's vectors to determine the closest match.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the steps required\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will define a set of classes you want to use. \n",
    "2. Collect a few sample documents for each class (minimum 1 sample max 10 samples each class)\n",
    "3. Create a CSV manifest file\n",
    "4. Run sampling using the manifest file, capture the `sample ID` (you will need this to run classification)\n",
    "5. Run classifications with new document using the `sample ID` from step 4.\n"
